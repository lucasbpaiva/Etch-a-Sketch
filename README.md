# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. You can hold down the mouse and hover over the tiles you want to color, or click individual tiles for more precise control. There are a number of options to choose from, including a RGB color picker, an opacity slider, an option to choose the size of the n x n square grid, an eraser and even an amusing rainbow mode that colors each pixel a random different color.

You can see the project live [here](https://lucasbpaiva.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/).

Here are some examples created using the tool:

This project was an important step in solidifying my knowledge of event listeners (handling multiple mouse events) and how to dynamically edit CSS options using JavaScript. Some challenges I faced were how to make the hover effect for coloring work only when the mouse was being pressed down, iterating through node lists to control the behavior of each individual tile in the square grid and handling state variables indicating if the eraser or rainbow mode was selected at any given moment.
